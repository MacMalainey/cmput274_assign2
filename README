Description:
 Proof of concept communication using RSA encryption over serial between two Arduinos

Included files:
 - encrypted_communication_part1.cpp
 - Makefile

Wiring instructions:
 -> Note pins on arduino X are denoted as such: PIN (X)
 -> Two Arduinos are used (denoted A, B)
 GND (A) -> GND (B)
 TX3 (A) -> RX3 (B)
 RX3 (A) -> TX3 (B)
 PIN 13 (A) -> 560 Ohm Resistor -> 5V (A)
 PIN 13 (B) -> GND (B)

Note:
 - uint32_to_serial, uint32_from_serial, and powmod functions used are slight modifications of the provided functions in assignments and lectures
 - Due to unknown reasons (assumed to be old hardware) a delay had to be added to uint32_from_serial to fix a
   bug where we read data before the data reached the buffer.
 - As in the assignment description we assume modulus will never be greater than 31 bits
